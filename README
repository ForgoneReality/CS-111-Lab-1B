CONTENTS:

lab1b-client.c: The C source file for the client. It opens a connection to the server using a socket,
and sends information from the keyboard to the socket. It simultaneously receives the processed information
back from the server, and displays it on the screen via STDOUT.

lab1b-server.c: The C source file for the server. It opens a passive connection and waits to receive information
from the client. Once it does, it converts it using a two-pipe shell similar to lab1a.c from the last lab, before
sending it back to the client.

README: This file which is basically a typical readme file lol

Makefile: The makefile for this lab. It contains the default make (along with clean and dist which work as expected),
and also contains two options to make just the client and the server ("client" and "server" respectively).
